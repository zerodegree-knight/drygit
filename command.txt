It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. Statusoutput does not show you any information regarding the committed project history
    git add – The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit
